## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To process the raw video data, you must have **FFmpeg** installed on your system.
* **FFmpeg**: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

### Install Python Dependencies
All required Python packages can be installed using the provided `requirements.txt`.

```bash
python -m venv venv_cherenkov
```

**Windows**
```bash
venv_cherenkov\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
source venv_cherenkov/bin/activate
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Acquisition
Due to the large file size, the raw video datasets used in this study are hosted externally.

## 🛠️ Data Processing

### 1. Preprocessing Raw Videos
After downloading the videos, place them in the appropriate directory and run:

```bash
python 0_preprocessing.py
```

This script performs:
- Cropping and concatenation of video segments
- Denoising using FFmpeg
- Extraction of per-frame RGB intensity values

## 📈 Reproducing Figures
All figures used in the paper can be regenerated by executing:

```bash
python Generate_Figure_xx.py
```

Each script reproduces the corresponding figure and saves it in the `Figures/` directory.
